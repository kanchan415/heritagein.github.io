<pre>Ram Raja Temple
    A tour of Orchha usually begins with a visit to this temple. Part of ruler Madhukar Shahâ€™s palace, this is the only temple where Ram, 
    the hero of the Indian epic Ramayana, is worshipped as the king, including being offered a guard of honour. The temple is open from 8am to 10pm.
    
    Orchha Fort
    This 16th century fort lies near the confluence of the Betwa and Jamni rivers. The sprawling fort complex contains several palaces inside,
     of which Jahangir Mahal, Raj Mahal, Sheesh Mahal and Rai Praveen Mahal, are very popular. Raj Mahal exhibits some fantastic murals. Jahangir
      Mahal exhibits a mix of Mughal and Bundela architecture; note the delicate lattice work along the courtyard. Sheesh Mahal has been converted 
      into a star hotel by Madhya Pradesh State Tourism Development Corporation (MPSTDC).
