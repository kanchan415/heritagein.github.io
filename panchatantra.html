</div><pre>Panchatantra Park is an animal-themed park mainly for children in Jhansi based on the ‘Panchatantra’ book by Vishnu Sharma. 
    Apart from several animal-themed slides for the children, this park also has a jogging track for adults.

    The park was developed by the Jhansi Development Authority on a vast stretch of a green patch in the middle of the city of Jhansi
     mainly for the children with exciting Panchatantra themed animal statues. Over the years, this has not only been an exciting spot for
      children but also adults for morning and evening walks where they can enjoy a soothing pollution-free environment, away from the hustle-bustle
       of the city.</pre>
