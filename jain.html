</div><pre>Karguvanji Jain temple is a 700-year-old temple, resting amidst the vicinity of Jhansi city. It is an important pilgrimage for
     Digambar Jains, a sect that believes in renouncing all material things to attain salvation â€“ including clothes. The full name of the 
     temple is Shri Digamber Jain Atishaya Kshetra Sanvaliya Parasnath Karguvanji, Atishay Kshetra meaning a place of miracles.

    As the name suggests, the biggest idol installed is of Parshvanatha (the 23rd Tirthankara) whose symbol is a snake. Situated on Jhansi-Kanpur 
    highway, Karguanji temple has an interesting history. The story goes back to the time of Peshwas when the dream of a man named Shri Singhai Nanheju 
    led to the discovery of idols hidden underground. The temple also has an in house facility for pilgrims. The Dharamshala has about 100 rooms with the
     availability of semi-deluxe and deluxe rooms</pre>
