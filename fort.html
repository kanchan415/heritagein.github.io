    Jhansi Fort, or Jhansi ka Kila as it is called, is an imposing fort lying on a big hilltop named Bangira in Uttar Pradesh. 
    It was a major fortification for the Chandela Kings from the 11th to the 17th century in Balwant Nagar. The Jhansi Fort lies in the center of Jhansi City. 
    It lies three kms away from the Jhansi Railway Station, while the nearest airport is located at Gwalior, 103 kms away from Jhansi. 
    You can also get down at the Jhansi Museum Bus Top to reach this fort.


Reaching the Jhansi Fort is quite easy, as the Jhansi town itself has grown around this structure. 
The Fort is positioned on the hilltop and all major landmarks and tourist attractions are located nearby, making it easy for all visitors.
 At the entrance to the Jhansi Fort, one is greeted by the iconic Kadak Bijli cannon that was operated by Gulam Gaus Khan. 
 There is also the Bhawani Shankar cannon which was handled by the legendary Moti Bai woman gunner as per local guides! Both soldiers laid down their lives for Her Majesty.
