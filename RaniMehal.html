<pre>The grandeur of Rani Mahal in Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, is very inviting. The architecture of Rani Mahal is the living 
    proof of the great artwork of the gone era. The palace has been the occupancy of the wife of Raja Madhukar Singh. The last occupant of the 
    palace was Rani Laxmi Bai. Now, it is preserved under Uttar Pradesh Tourism. This is one of the major attractions of Uttar Pradesh.
    
    Architecturally, it is a flat-roofed, two-storeyed building having a quadrangular courtyard with a small well and one fountain on opposite 
    sides. The palace consists of six halls and parallel corridors with multi-foiled arches and a number of small rooms. The Darbar Hall, approached 
    by a flight of steps, is beautifully decorated with paintings in bright colors exhibiting various floral, faunal, and geometrical motifs.
    
    The arches are embellished with peacock and rosette patterns. The major part of it was damaged by British bombardment during the siege of Jhansi 
    in 1858. The ground floor of the palace houses stone sculptures collected from Madanpur, Barua Sagar, Dudhai, and Chandpur dating from the Gupta 
    to Medieval periods.</pre>
