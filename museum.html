Jhansi Museum is one of the iconic museums of India constructed around the late 19th century that helps us to track down the roots of Indian history of colonial India. 
Jhansi Museum, also known as the UP Government museum, is known to have artefacts since the 4th century BC along with exquisite artworks of pre-modern India.

Dedicated to Rani Lakshmi Bai, this museum not only illustrates the history of Jhansi but also throws light on the Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh.
 Over the years, Jhansi museum has become one of the major tourist attractions in Uttar Pradesh owing to the rich cultural heritage of India, particularly Jhansi.
